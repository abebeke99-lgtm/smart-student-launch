## 🔄 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **End-to-End Evaluation Submission**
```
Navigate → Evaluate → Score All 20 → Submit → Database Saved ✓
```
- Validation ensures all 20 criteria are scored
- API submits to backend
- Database stores criteria_scores as JSON
- Upsert logic prevents duplicates
- Status updates immediately in UI

### 2. **Evaluation Viewing & Breakdown**
```
View Details → Breakdown Modal → Category Scores → Performance Level ✓
```
- Opens EvaluationBreakdownModal
- Displays total score (0-100)
- Shows all 5 categories with % breakdown
- Individual criterion scores visible
- Performance indicators (⭐ scale)

### 3. **Edit & Re-submission**
```
View → Edit Button → Modify Scores → Re-submit → DB Updated ✓
```
- Edit button opens criteria modal in edit mode
- All scores pre-filled
- Can modify any criterion
- Re-submission updates DB record (upsert)

### 4. **Database Persistence**
```
criteria_scores: JSON | total_score: 0-100 | Unique Constraint ✓
```
- Criteria scores stored as JSON: `{1: 4, 2: 5, ..., 20: 3}`
- Total score calculated and stored
- Timestamps auto-managed
- Unique constraint prevents duplicates

---

## 📊 Score Calculation

```
Total Score = (sum of all scores / 20 / 5) × 100

Example:
- All criteria @ 4/5 = 80/100
- All criteria @ 5/5 = 100/100
- All criteria @ 3/5 = 60/100
```

### Performance Levels
| Score | Rating | Indicator |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| 0-39 | Poor | ⭐ |
| 40-59 | Needs Improvement | ⭐⭐ |
| 60-74 | Good | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 75-89 | Very Good | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 90-100 | Excellent | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
